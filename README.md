Anilistity is extension for my own purposes, i just needed it for more comfortable use an [Anilist](Anilist.co).

## Current features:
- Translate an anime title in Russian
- Quick links to MAL and Shikimori sites
- Scores from MAL, Anilist and Shikimori (under a title or sidebar)

Currently its all, and I don't think that I'll bring something new, but maybe I will invent something :)
