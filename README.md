# Anilistify

Anilistity is extension for my own purposes, i just needed for more comfortable use an [Anilist](Anilist.co).

## Current features:
- Translate in Russian an anime title
- Quick links to MAL and Shikimori sites
- Scores from MAL, Anilist and Shikimori under a title or sidebar

Currently its all, and I don't think that I'll bring something new, but maybe I will invent something :)
